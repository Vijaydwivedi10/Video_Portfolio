            <h3>The Basics of Color Theory</h3>

                <img 
                    src={ColourWheel} 
                    alt="Color Wheel" 
                    className="colour-wheel-image"
                />
                <p>
                    Color theory revolves around the color wheel, a circular diagram representing relationships between colors. 
                    Colors are grouped into three main categories: primary, secondary, and tertiary colors.
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Primary Colors:</strong> These are the foundation of all other colors and include red, blue, and yellow.</li>
                        <li><strong>Secondary Colors:</strong> Created by mixing two primary colors, resulting in green, orange, and purple.</li>
                        <li><strong>Tertiary Colors:</strong> These are combinations of primary and secondary colors, offering a broader range of hues.</li>
                    </ul>
                    This framework helps designers understand how colors interact with each other. By using the color wheel, brands can create balanced and visually appealing combinations that enhance their brand's impact.

            <h3>The Psychology of Color</h3>
            <p>
                Colors evoke specific emotions and associations, making them crucial in branding. Each color carries a psychological meaning, which can influence how customers perceive your brand. Understanding the emotional impact of each color will help you choose the right palette for your brand:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Red:</strong> Associated with passion, energy, and urgency. It is often used by brands that want to evoke excitement or encourage action.</li>
                <li><strong>Blue:</strong> Represents trust, calmness, and professionalism. Many corporate and tech companies use blue to establish credibility and reliability.</li>
                <li><strong>Yellow:</strong> Signifies optimism, warmth, and attention-grabbing. It is ideal for brands looking to appear friendly and inviting.</li>
                <li><strong>Green:</strong> Connected to nature, health, and sustainability. Green is commonly used by eco-friendly brands or companies related to health and wellness.</li>
                <li><strong>Purple:</strong> Reflects luxury, creativity, and wisdom. It is often used by brands aiming for a premium or artistic appeal.</li>
                <li><strong>Orange:</strong> Represents enthusiasm, playfulness, and affordability. It is often used by brands targeting younger audiences or promoting fun, approachable products.</li>
                <li><strong>Black:</strong> Symbolizes elegance, sophistication, and power. Many luxury brands use black to convey exclusivity and high status.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                Keep in mind that cultural differences may influence how colors are perceived in different regions. For example, white may signify purity in some cultures but mourning in others. 
                Therefore, understanding your target audience's cultural background is important when selecting colors.

            <h3>Choosing the Right Color Palette</h3>
            <div className="image-text-wrapper">
                
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Know your audience:</strong> Your target audience plays a significant role in color selection. For example, younger audiences may gravitate towards vibrant and playful colors, while a more professional audience might prefer muted and sophisticated tones.</li>
                    <li><strong>Consider your competitors:</strong> Avoid using colors that are too similar to your competitors' branding, as this can cause confusion. Stand out by choosing a distinctive color that still aligns with your brand message.</li>
                    <li><strong>Use a primary and secondary color:</strong> Most brands have a primary color that is prominently featured, along with secondary and accent colors that support and complement it. Your primary color should be the most recognizable and associated with your brand.</li>
                    <li><strong>Test color combinations:</strong> Ensure that your chosen colors work well together in various contexts, including print, digital media, and product packaging. Colors should maintain legibility and consistency across all formats.</li>
                </ul>

                    src={BrandColours} 
                    alt="Brand Colours" 
                    className="brand-colours-image"
                />
            </div>

            <h3>Application in Branding</h3>
            <p>
                Once you've selected your color palette, it's important to apply it consistently across all brand elements. Consistency helps to reinforce brand recognition and create a cohesive visual identity. 
                Whether it's your logo, website, social media profiles, or marketing materials, maintaining the same color scheme across all platforms ensures a strong and unified brand presence. 
                Additionally, you can experiment with using your colors strategically to evoke specific emotions or guide customer behavior. For instance, using red on a "Buy Now" button can encourage urgency, while blue can create a calming effect for informational sections.
